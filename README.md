# Getting started

The best way to run this, is to run Config-App.sln.

That has all the required functions.

## Things which can be added more 
- Validate the textboxes with regex functions for textboxes such as APN (Access Point Network), Local Host, SSID, and Password. But I need the format to create this Regex validator.
