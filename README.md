# Getting started

The best way to run this, is to run Config-App.sln.

That has all the required functions.


## Not all functions are complete.

## Things missing
- A function to check if the required information is filled.

- The radio buttons do not work.

- Exit button missing.

- Dropdown boxes need to be added.
